# STM32-Blinky-HAL-on-Blue-Pill
A minimal STM32F103C8T6 (Blue Pill) project demonstrating how to toggle the onboard LED using the STM32 HAL library. This example shows the basic project structure generated with STM32CubeMX, GPIO configuration, and a simple main loop for beginners learning STM32 development.
